# CNN vs Vision Transformer

This repository contains code to compare the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) on image classification tasks.

## Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks have been the go-to model for computer vision tasks for years. However, Vision Transformers, introduced in 2020, have shown promising results, often outperforming CNNs on a number of tasks. This project aims to compare these two types of models on the MNIST dataset.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/john221wick/cnn-vs-vit.git
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the cnn script:
    ```bash
    python3 cnn.py
    ```
4. Run the vision transformer script:
    ```bash
    python3 vision_transformer.py
    ```

## Results

The results of the comparison will be updated here soon.
